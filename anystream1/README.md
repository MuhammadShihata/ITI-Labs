The main diffrences that navbar changes according to the role of the logged in user 
anonymous will see register / user login
user will see browse page, account settings, logout 
admin will see dashboard(browse with control buttons edit & delete for each video), add video page, account settings, logout 

if you logged in and clicked on any movie you will go to the player page where you can watch the video...
