# Anystream

Running on Github Pages : https://mushihata.github.io/iti-labs/anystream1/index.html

Try open html pages with different roles anonymous / user / admin 
- All pages requires admin login both regular user & anonymous user can't see the content without login login

- All pages require user login anonymous user can't see without user login frist

To login as admin you have to go ../adminLogin.html from the address bar admin con login as a reglar user and can login as admin depends on which login page he will choose 
- username(admin): mushihata 
- password: 1234

The main diffrences that navbar changes according to the role of the logged in user 
- anonymous will see register / user login
- user will see browse page, account settings, logout 
- admin will see dashboard(browse with control buttons edit & delete for each video), add video page, account settings, logout 

if you logged in and clicked on any movie you will go to the player page where you can watch the video...

if you tested offline make sure to run live server for subtitles fetch to work...
